# Important News!!
Howdy! i have important news about arcfox. for the last month nothing changed much. arcfox at the moment have some bugs but it's totally usable. But this is not the end i want arcfox to be one of the best ways to use arcfox and something that goes to the limit of the possibilities of firefox customization. I'm currently rebuilding my tech stack from zero. so i'm gonna learn everything i know again and then re-code arcfox. it's gonna take some time but i wish you stay with me on that time and be patient while i improve arcfox. thank you so much for liking arcfox for so much time.

# What is ArcFox?
<img src="screenshot.png"/>

ArcFox is a pack of firefox improvements that brings the appearance and some of the features of arc browser to firefox. Recently, The Browser Company © (the developers of arc browser) announced a windows version, so this project almost lost the reason to exist. But there still a linux version to be made and some people just like firefox and don't want to change.

I really recomend you to give a try on arc browser if you can. But we gonna do our best to make firefox nice as arc.
