# What is ArcFox?

<img src="public/media/screenshot.png"/>

ArcFox is a pack of firefox improvements that brings the appearance and some of the features of arc browser to firefox. Recently, The Browser Company © (the developers of arc browser) announced a Windows version, so this project almost lost the reason to exist. But there's still a linux version to be made and some people just like firefox and don't want to change.

I really recomend you to give a try on arc browser if you can. But we gonna do our best to make firefox nice as arc.

# Installation

### ArcFox-core Installation

To install arcfox-core you need to download it on your firefox, we recommend you to download from the official addon store:

> Warning: To use arcfox you need arcfox theme!!

<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/arcfox/">

</a>

### ArcFox-Theme Installation

To install arcfox-theme you need to open your firefox configurations and turn style modification on. To do that please follow this steps:

- Digit <a href="about:config">"about:config"</a> on firefox address bar and click enter.
- On the search bar, search for "toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets" and set the value to "true".
- Open <a href="about:support">"about:support"</a> and click on the “Open Folder” button on the right of "Profile Folder" to open it.
- When the folder opens, search for a folder called "chrome", if you don't find it create one.
- Inside the "chrome" folder, drop the "userChrome.css" that you find on the <a href="https://github.com/betterbrowser/arcfox/releases">releases.</a>
- Restart firefox.

# Removing ArcFox

If you have a major issue, or just want a different/default look, here is how to remove ArcFox.

1. Remove `(Firefox Profile)/chrome/userchrome.css`

2. Remove the 'ArcFox' extension from Firefox

3. Restart your Firefox session, and it should be fixed! If not, make an issue in the issues tab

4. Be happy with your now boring and unproductive firefox!
